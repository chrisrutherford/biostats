## Final Project
A neural network that attempts to differentiate benign skin moles and malignant skin cancers. Uses the pre-trained ResNet18 network to help with training.
Images were obtained directly using the [`bing-image-downloader` library](https://pypi.org/project/bing-image-downloader/). "Benign skin mole" was the query used for benign images, while "malignant skin cancer" was used for the malignant images.
